### Practice Problems

---

1. Write a SQL statement that will return the following result:

   ```psql
    id |     author      |           categories
   ----+-----------------+--------------------------------
     1 | Charles Dickens | Fiction, Classics
     2 | J. K. Rowling   | Fiction, Fantasy
     3 | Walter Isaacson | Nonfiction, Biography, Physics
   (3 rows)
   ```

```sql
SELECT books.id, books.author, string_agg(categories.name, ', ') AS categories
  FROM books
    INNER JOIN books_categories ON books.id = books_categories.book_id
    INNER JOIN categories ON books_categories.category_id = categories.id
  GROUP BY books.id ORDER BY books.id;
```

---

2. Write SQL statements to insert the following new books into the database. What do you need to do to ensure this data fits in the database?

   | Author                        | Title                                      | Categories                               |
   | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
   | Lynn Sherr                    | Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space | Biography, Nonfiction, Space Exploration |
   | Charlotte Brontë              | Jane Eyre                                  | Fiction, Classics                        |
   | Meeru Dhalwala and Vikram Vij | Vij's: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine | Cookbook, Nonfiction, South Asia         |

We have to update the `title` column to accomodate for longer title lengths. 

```sql
ALTER TABLE books ALTER COLUMN title TYPE VARCHAR(50);

INSERT INTO books (title, author)
VALUES ('Sally Ride: America''s First Woman in Space', 'Lynn Sherr'),
('Jane Eyre', 'Charlotte Bronte'),
('Vij''s: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine', 'Meeru Dhalwala and Vikram Vij');

INSERT INTO categories (name)
VALUES ('Space Exploration'),
('Cookbook'),
('South Asia');

INSERT INTO books_categories (book_id, category_id)
VALUES (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 7),
(5, 2), (5, 4),
(6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 9);
```

3. Write a SQL statement to add a uniqueness constraint on the combination of columns `book_id` and `category_id` of the `books_categories` table. This contraint should be a table constraint; so, it should check for uniqueness on the combination of `book_id` and `category_id` across all rows of the `books_categories` table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE books_categories ADD UNIQUE (book_id, category_id);
```

4. Write a SQL statement that will return the following result:

   ```psql
         name        | book_count |                                 book_titles
   ------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Biography         |          2 | Einstein: His Life and Universe, Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space
   Classics          |          2 | A Tale of Two Cities, Jane Eyre
   Cookbook          |          1 | Vij's: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine
   Fantasy           |          1 | Harry Potter
   Fiction           |          3 | Jane Eyre, Harry Potter, A Tale of Two Cities
   Nonfiction        |          3 | Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, Einstein: His Life and Universe, Vij's: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine
   Physics           |          1 | Einstein: His Life and Universe
   South Asia        |          1 | Vij's: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine
   Space Exploration |          1 | Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space
   ```

```sql
SELECT categories.name, COUNT(books.id) AS book_count, string_agg(books.title, ', ') AS book_titles
  FROM categories
 INNER JOIN books_categories ON categories.id = category_id
 INNER JOIN books ON books.id = book_id
 GROUP by categories.name
 ORDER BY categories.name;
